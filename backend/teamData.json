He's obsessively story-driven, the kind of editor who won't let a frame exist unless it earns its place in the narrative. Color, rhythm, pacing—it all serves the feeling, the moment, the truth you're chasing. He doesn't just edit your project; he makes sure your story gets told the way it deserves to be told",
